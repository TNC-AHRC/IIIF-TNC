00:09
um
00:10
okay so uh welcome everybody to
00:13
today's webinar um showcasing the
00:16
practical use of
00:17
aaaf it is the first webinar
00:20
uh of our project practical applications
00:23
of triple f is a building block towards
00:25
a digital national collection
00:27
which is part of a uh the larger towards
00:30
a national collection program
00:34
we will have a series of presentations
00:36
today uh in two sessions
00:38
uh the first session uh is about
00:41
existing triple
00:41
f work that's been done in three
00:43
different areas
00:45
which will then be followed by a break
00:47
um because obviously we don't want to
00:48
sit here for two and a half hours all in
00:49
one go
00:50
um break for 15 minutes and
00:53
then we'll have a another session of a
00:55
set of
00:56
talks about our actual project and the
00:58
work that we're hoping to do
00:59
or we are going to do as the project
01:01
progresses um each of the talks will be
01:03
about sort of 12 15 minutes or so long
01:05
um the idea is that we'll have a time
01:09
for
01:09
questions at the end of each session
01:13
but if you can if you do have burning
01:15
questions you want to ask as the talks
01:17
are going on you can drop them into the
01:19
q a section and we'll try and then
01:22
uh get to them during the question
01:25
period
01:26
um i should say that if as there are
01:28
quite a lot of you 187 now
01:30
uh if you all start asking questions we
01:32
probably won't be able to answer them
01:33
all
01:34
uh during the actual time allotted but
01:36
we'll try and capture them all
01:38
and then see if we can answer questions
01:40
and put them up on the project website
01:41
which yeah you can see the url therefore
01:44
on the page
01:45
in front of you um and then we'll try
01:48
and answer those questions later on
01:50
um okay so today
01:53
um we are going to have uh
01:56
i we had up to sort of over 330 people
01:59
actually registered
02:00
it peaked at 350 so um if we can
02:03
actually have 200 people
02:04
who actually connect to the the webinar
02:07
itself that would be really really good
02:09
um today as i said for representing
02:11
examples of how triple f is used for
02:12
public engagement
02:13
uh and then followed by a session of um
02:16
the
02:17
work and the planned work for our actual
02:19
project
02:20
um i don't know if you can spot your
02:22
cities i've used the uh
02:24
cities of all of the people who have
02:25
registered and dropped into the triple f
02:27
logo there
02:28
on the right um to uh sort of show
02:31
the the very wide spread of people we've
02:33
got here so uh welcome to you all
02:36
um and thank you very much to those of
02:37
you from rather
02:39
different time zones um we have people
02:42
from
02:42
right the way across america and uh even
02:45
some people from japan
02:47
and seoul so thank you very much for
02:50
attending today now just to begin with
02:54
i'm pretty sure most of you will know
02:56
what trip life is as you signed up for
02:58
this webinar but to give
02:59
just to reiterate um triple f
03:03
is the international image
03:04
interoperability framework
03:06
um it's an international standard for
03:08
sharing high resolution
03:09
images on the web um and that's also
03:11
extended to audio visual material
03:14
and they're also working on 3d although
03:18
that's not part of the standard at the
03:19
moment some very very good work being
03:21
done
03:21
and i wholeheartedly recommend that you
03:23
have a little look at their website and
03:25
the
03:25
community as a whole for triple a f
03:27
there's a lot of very good work being
03:28
done
03:30
now to give you a very brief idea of how
03:33
triple f works
03:34
um very quickly um if we have an
03:37
instance here where we have the national
03:38
gallery um
03:39
uh where i work the
03:42
we have an image store and triple f
03:44
server within the national gallery
03:46
and an internal triple f viewer we can
03:48
view lots of images now i'll come back
03:49
to that
03:50
more in more detail later in full
03:52
presentation
03:53
but if we also have the yale center for
03:55
british art
03:57
who are presenting images and have a
03:58
triple f server and actually have a
04:00
public
04:01
openc dragon viewer available for people
04:03
to explore their images
04:05
you can take the triple f manifest which
04:07
is a description which i'm sure we'll go
04:08
through a couple of times today
04:11
of the images and all of the metadata
04:13
required to
04:14
work with the images and then drop that
04:16
into a viewer
04:18
within the national gallery so the
04:20
triple f standard allows
04:22
workers within one institution to view
04:24
and
04:25
explore images from another institution
04:27
without actually copying the images
04:29
so a store wants to make use of in lots
04:32
of different places
04:34
so that's the general concept um very
04:36
very briefly
04:37
we'll be going over this in a number of
04:39
the talks today
04:40
but just to highlight that um i know
04:43
obviously at scale
04:44
uh if we think within our project if we
04:46
extend that
04:47
example to the portrait gallery dna the
04:49
british library the science museum group
04:51
and many others
04:52
um if we're all sharing things using the
04:54
same standards
04:55
we can actually look at some fairly
04:58
sizable cross collection and
04:59
cross-domain sort of outputs and
05:03
solutions there and there's a lot of
05:05
work we can do but you can also look at
05:07
closed commercial issues for apps and
05:09
potentially as i'm going to talk about
05:11
later
05:12
issues you can work on within an
05:13
institution to make use of your own
05:15
triple f
05:16
sources now our project as a whole aims
05:19
to highlight and demonstrate
05:21
opportunities and benefits
05:22
of the triple life standard i'm going to
05:24
examine its potential for
05:26
virtually connecting collections from
05:28
different organizations
05:30
uh document lists of existing trip live
05:33
systems and tools
05:35
and contribute to the work that's going
05:36
on in the triple f consortium
05:39
and identify what additional tools and
05:42
services might be needed
05:43
the digital tools and services will be
05:44
sort of covered in a future
05:46
webinar this is the team um several of
05:49
the team members are here
05:51
today myself joseph hadfield i'm the pi
05:55
of the project and i work in the
05:57
national gallery
05:58
but co-eyes on this ahrc-funded project
06:02
also include torsten river for the
06:04
british library charlotte bowling from
06:06
the national portrait gallery melissa
06:07
terrace from edmond university
06:09
and we also have a a white sort of
06:12
collection of project partners
06:14
uh lorna tom tom uh
06:17
jamie richard and glenn so it's it's
06:19
from the
06:20
royal botanical gardens did your rt bna
06:22
stanford library science museum group
06:24
and the triple f consortium there is an
06:27
interim
06:27
project uh sort of report for our our
06:31
project
06:32
um that was out in december 2020 and you
06:34
can actually download that from
06:35
the uh triple f website uh not sorry the
06:39
the towards the national collection
06:41
website um you can get that from there
06:44
um and uh that will be available we'll
06:47
drop some links
06:48
uh into but i'll drop some links into
06:50
the the chat
06:52
after i finish this introduction uh for
06:54
the things i've mentioned here
06:56
uh this is the first webinar as i said
06:58
we will be carrying out at least two
06:59
other
07:00
uh main web webinars for this project um
07:03
the next one will be discussing the
07:04
potential shared trip life services
07:06
and the third one developing practical
07:08
solutions um
07:09
actually more practical workshop uh
07:11
we'll also be looking at developing
07:14
these sort of four demonstrator areas or
07:16
exploring what work has already been
07:17
done within the field
07:19
to answer these issues so specifically
07:21
creating a data set of 16th century
07:23
british portraits which we'll be talking
07:25
about later
07:26
how we can support publications looking
07:30
at
07:31
working with triple f uh manifests uh
07:33
which will be uh described a lot by tom
07:35
later
07:36
and uh exploring new use cases and
07:38
particularly looking at user feedback
07:40
and user evaluation
07:41
of the work that we're doing so um
07:44
to move on to the session as a whole i'm
07:46
going to stop talking now and hand over
07:48
