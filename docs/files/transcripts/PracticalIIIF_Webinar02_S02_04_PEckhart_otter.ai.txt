Hello, thanks for having me. I'm a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer of mediaeval history at the University of Freiburg, where, and I work in cardiology and history and history of knowledge and for my research and for my teaching, I work a lot with digital productions and IIIF viewers and some tools and the project I'm currently building are hoping to build will operate on digital images of manuscripts and rare books using annotations via Mirador and IIIF and using a Freizo based ancestor workflow, developed by Data Futures, and that provides safekeeping and ongoing development of annotations and then generation of repository outputs as Gustavo Fernandez Riva pointed out in a recent digital medievalist webinar, there seem to be two trends in using annotations, right now and digital manuscripts and studies or especially Digital Editions. On the one hand it's annotations that operate directly on the image with the image as the integral part of editorial activities, and on the other hand, there are approaches that keep the text but abstract as much of the material. So, in order to then do stylometry or linguistic annotations, and I'm I think I myself like Andrew Prescott, I think. I'm interested in operating on the image directly. And although working with digital reproductions of manuscripts has its shortcomings and you can't equate it with working on the original, surely I think digital images have advantage, advantages if research questions focus not only on the text, but on visual features as well. So for my project, I'm looking for way and workspace to store and organise all the textual visual and material information codecologists routinely collect while looking at a page or transcribing. And my goal is not editing, as such, but operating directly on the image, or part of a canvas and keep that visual features in the analysis. So the annotation models should work on three levels, text or content, visual organisation of the page, and physical description of the object. What the Freizo instance does: it serves to create searchable annotations and visualise search results by showing annotated regions of canvases synoptically to hopefully reveal patterns of text phenomena in and across codices. And furthermore, the goal is to make annotations themselves primary research assets, which can be discovered with search tools, and harvesting interfaces, and then consumed by external applications. My current challenges for me right now is suddenly building an annotation model on a selection of objects that then can serve most potential future needs on very heterogeneous and unpredictable material. And secondly, to gain enough technological Insight, I'm not a very tech person to understand potentials and limits to the project and make informed decisions about them. And in the long run, I think, with all digital projects, the transition from research workflow which I'm now focusing on to research at rest in the end, will present difficulties of sustainability and preservation of the data I think we all know that. And talking to Data Futures drew my attention to this problem but also to the possibility of large scale solutions to generate to automate IIIF services and data management and migration. Data Futures generate Invenio repositories automatically from the Freizo instances and upcoming later this year is Invenio RDM, which enables continued enrichment of the research data within the repository so that you don't have to keep the Freizo running in the long run.

As far as I understand it Invenio RDM basically makes long term preservation solutions developed in the physical sciences available and adaptable for digital humanities, It fixes some of the functionality gaps in Zenodo and could become the collaboratively operated solution for the preservation of human humanity research data, like a library structure for digital projects. Yeah, and I don't really feel like giving advice because I am just starting myself right now, but I think, get help. There's lots of stuff that you can watch and read. I think there's already one question about that there's lots of tutorials and videos, and then there are very many nice people. You can talk to and they help you get along. So, that's for me. Thank you.
