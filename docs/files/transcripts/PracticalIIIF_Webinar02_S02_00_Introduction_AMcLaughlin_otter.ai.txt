All right, so it's quarter-to. So thank you all who have stuck with us for the break, we're very looking forward to having all of our panellists here with us today. This is meant to be a lively and discursive section so please do not hesitate, with any questions you have in the count, and we've got a wide range of representatives and expertise here, who should hopefully be able to answer your questions, whatever they may be. My name is Anne McLaughlin, I'm the Senior Research Fellow on the practical triple IIIF project working out of the National Gallery, and it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers today, they will be giving short introductions of themselves and their projects just at the onset here, and will be concluding their introductions, with if they had one piece of advice for someone implementing IIIF, or what do they wish they had known before they began their implementation journey, as a way to just sort of kick start our discussion.
