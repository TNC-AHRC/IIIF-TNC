Yes, thanks. So I've been given five minutes, so I'll be brief, I just quickly want to introduce two projects, I've been working on now I'm affiliated to Ghent University Centre for digital humanities, and my focus will actually be a small scale one, and I will be taking an educational perspective I'm scientific collaborator, but I've been working on some student projects at our faculty, for which we have been using, among other things, IIIF so I briefly want to show this to you and I will be delving into the MADOC transcription and annotation platform that's being developed by Digirati and which was touched upon by Jason before, I think. And there was one peculiar case with Congo Comics that we're setting up, so I want to show this to you. Before I start, this is another project that I've been working on, and that has finished, it was a rather peculiar one, it was an omeka s project we wait with master's students from the Art Department. And starting point for 39 murder cases with the court files, and the court records, which included pictures and so we gave every student one murder case and they could analyse this to study the interwar interior. Sometimes we have to blur corpses and stuff, but it made it a rather fun project. Now we use omeka s as a virtual collection device, we also made virtual exposition, we use Universal Viewer. In the visual exhibition. For example, we also let students tag pictures so say for example you wanted to see all the pictures that had a crucifix and you could use that tag and you will give them all the pictures, photographs with a crucifix. Now we did use and it came up in an earlier presentation the Storiiies app that would serve very simple and direct app, but we let students use it to provide digital storytelling so they could analyse images what was to be seen on the image and we integrated that in the Omeka exposition. We also used DeOldify which I think most of you will know. These were two simple tools that weren't really a gimmick but were really something worthwhile and really convinced the students of these simple digital tools, and the value of them. So this was the Omeka project and it was a two year project and it finally turned into a physical exhibition, which is actually on display, now, in Ghent. This as a first project and introduction. What I wanted to show you is another project worth setting up next year and it starts from the collection of comics by Papa Mfumu'eto is Congolese comic artists, and we're speaking about small collection 300 comics, but it touches on daily life and politics in Congo in the night from 1980 to 2000 So really interesting troubling period and why do you want to do with these comics, it's rather simple, and self-evident but want to transcribe what is to be seen, translate them as well because we're speaking about a Lingala and French collections so we want to translate it, we have to annotate the images showcase the results of that, and also use it for a physical exhibition in the future so it's a student project again. And what is cooler, in this case is that we also want to use it as a Lingala learning device this project.

So I mentioned MADOC so we're actually developing MADOM 2.0 Right now, which is the IIIF Transcription annotation platform and it allows us to make IIIF ollections or reorganise them to enrich those collections, so it's a crowdsourcing platform but it can of course be used by a close group of students and so we've met, you can alter metadata add metadata and transcriptions, name entities, linked to external vocabularies, so you can use it as a crowdsourcing device, and also to showcase the results. Now like as. In conclusion, I just want to show you for this comic book project, what are the what is the workflow and the steps we're taking. So the collection of Papa Mfumu'eto is scattered in three parts around the globe. So we have a part in Florida we have the private part in Switzerland, and a small part is in Ghent University so we're having these three collections as IIIF manifests, then this allows us to pull it into MADOC and rearrange it, as we wish. So we can make sub-collections, and this is what we will intend to use for our student projects so we will give one student or two students say one comic book, and we'll ask them to annotate, what is in that comic, transcribe, it translated. Now, there is a third part, we will have to segment our images so will this be something, is this something that students will do, is it something that the teacher will do, is this something that we want to automate this is still an open question that we can segment it in MADOC. Now this is the enrichment part so we will simply ask students we have made a capture model, which is in MADOC. The term to enrich your IIIF manifest so we can ask students to tag people tag places, transcribe the texts, translate them. And then the admin parts. It allows, MADOC allows, the reviewer to to review also to correct. Also to merge, say for example two versions that were crowdsourced and, for example, as you can see there, the admin can request changes so this is really where we see the MADOC and the IIIF technology as a way of using it as Lingala learning device so we're talking about bachelor students trying to learn Lingala so this is a really applied manner for them to learn Lingala. And the last phase is then to display the enriched collection of course and also to use it for a physical collection so to display for example the translations, visitors can then read the comic in say for example, English. So, as after it has been translated from Lingala or from French. My piece of advice, I slightly altered the question, not for people implementing IIIF but for teachers implementing IIIF, and is based on my experience, with the first project is collaborate as a researcher with your students so really present it and share the project with your students to make, to really have this applied, sense of what they're doing. But it's not just another paper but they're really contributing to something that is out there that is shared globally on the web, and also let's students collaborate, these platforms such as MADOC are just perfect to let students collaborate on something something very concrete, and as my experiences, it really helps grow their enthusiasm for this kind of projects. Thank you.
