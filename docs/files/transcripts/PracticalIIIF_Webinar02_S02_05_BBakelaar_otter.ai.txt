All right. Hi, thanks very much for having us. My name is Ben Bakelaar, and my background is in technology. I spent 15 years working in IT. And during that time I developed a second career in design and user experience. And for the past five years I've been able to combine those skill sets and apply them to digital humanities projects. So I work on two, mainly the Thomas Edison Papers at Rutgers University, and the Vatican Film Library at St. Louis University, both of which are essentially microfilm collections. And so over the past five years, I've been able to learn all about the digital humanities field, cultural heritage, and IIIF, and so I have lots of lots of thoughts. And I think one of the, maybe unique things I can contribute here is just talking a little bit about user, the user experience of IIIF. So there's so much technology involved in IIIF and so many possibilities as a project, thinking about implementing IIIF or expanding your use of IIIF right, there's a lot of excitement, a lot of possibilities, many things you can do. Everyone sees lots of potential. And so the piece of advice that I can offer everyone from the kind of design mindset, is to think about what your goals are, as an organisation. And you may think you know them but can you write them down, succinctly, write in a couple bullet points. That's a very good starting point, take that one step further beyond your organisational goals, what are the goals of your users. The users you're doing all this work to share your resources with the world, who are those users. The world is not a good persona to build off of. Right. So getting as specific as you can. You don't have to feel like you're excluding people, but who is your primary audience, really, is it researchers, is it the public? This is gonna influence your choices of which features you work on implementing and how you present them in your interface. Don't get distracted by other people's goals and comparing yourself to other people's websites. A lot of times, there's a lot of technology, time and money behind those fancy tools, right, and with just the basics of IIIF there's already so much potential there. That is introduced to the image to the object. To let people reuse it and do innovative and novel things with it. So just to conclude, think about not only what your goals are, as the organisation, but also what your user's goals are, the more clear you can get on that, the better the experience will be.
