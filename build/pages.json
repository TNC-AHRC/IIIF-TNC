IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available [IIIF compliant software|https://iiif.io/apps-demos/], represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images. However, though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. Also, a better understanding of how to combine IIIF resources across multiple institutions and present a National Collection, to diverse audiences, is needed.</p><p>This project aims to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits that IIIF offers, to a wide audience of users and help to define more robust use cases of IIIF, for institutions, but also for individual researchers who want to re-use and exploit IIIF resources to carry out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. This work will highlight existing software and resources and identify what new tools, services or training might be required to maximise the potential of IIIF within the heritage community.</p><p>This will be achieved through a series of targeted workshops and surveys, along with the creation of pilot demonstrators, to provide tangible examples of what can be achieved. This process will involve both technical and non-technical researchers in collaboratively building resources, to increase mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p>",

In advance of the workshop, project partners will develop a proposal for a virtual collection, brought together from materials hosted by different institutions. This will be shared with participants in advance, to allow them to critique it. During the workshop we will then assess current IIIF abilities to deliver this vision together with other existing standards, and establish requirements for further development of IIIF. These will be documented and shared with the wider IIIF community, to become part of the roadmap. The workshop will be hosted and facilitated by the British Library, inspired by strategic plans around facilitation of shared discovery and access solutions.</p><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/Webinar%202%20Flyer%20-%20Final.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Flyer for the Practical IIIF Webinar on Services and Tools.\"></figure>",

To the right is his close friend, Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur. This portrait was painted at a time of religious upheaval in Europe. Although the pope had refused to annull Henry VIII, King of England’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon which resulted in a break with the Roman Catholic Church, in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn. The array of objects on the table seem to allude to discord; the arithmetic book, for example, is open at the page concerning mathematical division.</p><p> The portrait is a supreme display of Holbein’s skill in composing images and in manipulating oil paint to recreate a variety of textures. If viewed from a particular angle the elongated shape between the men’s feet becomes a skull. Equally hidden at the top left of the picture is a crucifix that hints at the hope of redemption in the resurrected Christ (text courtesy of the National Gallery).<p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><h2>Further Resources</h2><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/detail01_cogapp.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Hans Holbein the Younger, Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve ('The Ambassadors').\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">[Cogapp | https://www.cogapp.com/]'s Storiiies Editor uses IIIF in order to create curated tours <p> through cultural resources.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The art of painting miniatures in watercolour was introduced to England in the 1520s by the Flemish artist Gerard Horenbout. When Hans Holbein came to England from Switzerland in 1532 to work for Henry VIII, he was an established painter in oil on panel. But miniatures had become an established court art and Holbein clearly found it advisable to learn this new watercolour art. <p> In 1539 it became politically necessary for Henry to form an alliance with Protestant Germany and it was suggested that Henry marry one of the daughters of the Duke of Cleves. Henry needed to judge whether to proceed with the marriage treaty and Holbein was despatched to paint Anne and her sister Amelia. When Anne arrived in England, Henry thought her 'nothing so fair as had been reported', but the marriage still took place, in 1540. A few months later Henry decided the alliance was no longer necessary and the marriage was declared null. He designated Anne 'King's sister' and she settled down to life in England. </p><p>The ivory box is difficult to date, but is likely to post-date the miniature. It was turned on a lathe. Paint losses at the edge of the miniature, and the lack of a gold edge line on it, imply that it was trimmed to fit into the box. Such skilled turning of ivory was unknown in England at this date but was common in Germany. It could have been made by a German ivory turner, either in Britain or on the Continent. Collections of virtuoso turned ivories were being formed in Dresden and Munich at the time. However the box probably dates from the late sixteenth century, and as such is one of the earliest and most important post-medieval ivories in the collection.</p><p>More information about this object is available on [The V&A Website|https:\/\/collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O18966/portrait-miniature-of-anne-of-portrait-miniature-hans-holbein/\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]",
