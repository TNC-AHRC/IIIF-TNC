IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available [IIIF compliant software|https://iiif.io/apps-demos/], represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images. However, though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. Also, a better understanding of how to combine IIIF resources across multiple institutions and present a National Collection, to diverse audiences, is needed.</p><p>This project aims to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits that IIIF offers, to a wide audience of users and help to define more robust use cases of IIIF, for institutions, but also for individual researchers who want to re-use and exploit IIIF resources to carry out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. This work will highlight existing software and resources and identify what new tools, services or training might be required to maximise the potential of IIIF within the heritage community.</p><p>This will be achieved through a series of targeted workshops and surveys, along with the creation of pilot demonstrators, to provide tangible examples of what can be achieved. This process will involve both technical and non-technical researchers in collaboratively building resources, to increase mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p>",

In advance of the workshop, project partners will develop a proposal for a virtual collection, brought together from materials hosted by different institutions. This will be shared with participants in advance, to allow them to critique it. During the workshop we will then assess current IIIF abilities to deliver this vision together with other existing standards, and establish requirements for further development of IIIF. These will be documented and shared with the wider IIIF community, to become part of the roadmap. The workshop will be hosted and facilitated by the British Library, inspired by strategic plans around facilitation of shared discovery and access solutions.</p>",

The event, facilitated by the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, will be a combination of technical development and practical use case discussion. Prior to the workshop specific sets of IIIF resources will be sourced along with relevant research questions, user needs and or use case scenarios. These will then be made available before the webinar/workshop, allowing technical specialists to connect with nontechnical domain experts to create collaborative plans for the event. The activities will then be carried out in stages allowing the various groups to observe and benefit from each other’s work.</p>",

Additional work will also be carried out by the project Researcher to gather further information relating to user needs and assessments. A series of online surveys will be created to gather general information and then also to allow users to comment and provide feedback on their experiences of testing the technology demonstrators generated and identified within the project.</p>",
